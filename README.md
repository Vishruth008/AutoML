# AutoML Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This project involves using an AutoML library like H2O.ai to create multivariate predictive models and interpret them. The aim is to find significant relationships within the data using multiple algorithms and address common concerns in modeling, such as multicollinearity, model assumptions, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Objectives
- Utilize an AutoML tool to create and evaluate multiple predictive models.
- Analyze the significance of relationships identified by each model.
- Ensure that model assumptions are met and identify any multicollinearity.
- Rank and exclude insignificant predictor variables in multivariate models.
- Assess the impact of regularization and determine the most important hyperparameters.
- Provide clear explanations, an abstract, and a conclusion for the analysis.

## Key Questions Addressed
1. **Is the relationship significant?**
2. **Are any model assumptions violated?**
3. **Is there multicollinearity in the model?**
4. **Are predictor variables independent of each other?**
5. **Rank the most significant predictor variables and exclude insignificant ones.**
6. **Does the model make sense?**
7. **Does regularization help?**
8. **Which independent variables are significant?**
9. **Which hyperparameters are important?**
